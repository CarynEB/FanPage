•	    <h1>The Voices of Woman are Struggling to be Heard</h1>
•	
•	    <p>Despite all the progress women have made in the last several decades, they are still treated like second-class citizens in all the ways
•	      that matter. Women are attacked for our feelings. Are we too emotional? On average, women earn 23% less than women. On a darker note
•	      1 in 3 women have experienced sexual assault or rape at some point in their lives. And the majority of these cases have not seen
•	      justice. 
•	    </p>

•	    <h2>I don't just speak for the victims and survivors. I am a survivor and we must endure.</h2>

•	    <ul>
•	      <li>Women are just as if not smarter than men  </li>
•	      <li>Sexism in the technology industry is overt, subtyle or covert occupational, which makes the industry less friendly</li>
•	    </ul>
